This project aims to predict Parkinson's disease using various machine learning algorithms. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early and accurate prediction can significantly help in managing and treating the disease. This repository contains the implementation of multiple machine learning models to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease based on features extracted from biomedical voice measurements.
